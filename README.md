In the United States, higher education is vital to furthering individuals' social and economic growth. A master's degree is one of the most efficient methods to get the information and skills required to survive in an increasingly competitive and fast-changing environment. Nonetheless, with so many good institutions and universities to pick from, deciding on the best one might be difficult.

The goal of this visualization project is to evaluate and provide information on the best master's programs at colleges in the United States. The goal is to help prospective students make educated judgments by offering a complete visual picture of the country's top colleges, including insights into key factors like beginning wages, student-to-faculty ratios, and admission rates.

To achieve this purpose, I gathered information from a variety of sources, including renowned organizations and important performance metrics. The information was then presented in a visually appealing and user-friendly style using data visualization techniques.

The major goal of my project is to give prospective students an overview of the country's leading colleges and institutions, as well as critical criteria for making educated selections about where to continue their master's degree. I think that by doing so, I may make the process of picking a university less intimidating and clearer.
